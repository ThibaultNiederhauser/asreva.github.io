# Introduction

Friendship is a major component of social life in most cultures. It is known to be crucial for mental stability. However, the threat of isolation is growing each year in most of the "westernized" countries, and with it is the threat of depression. In some countries, like Japan, a name exists to define a person that completly withdraws from society: Hikikomori (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hikikomori). In addition to this tendency, the sanitary crisis of the year 2020 forced a lot of people to isolate themself. It is crucial for the States to understand how friendship is influenced in order to address these issues by favorizing friendships creation.

Here's a useless table:

| Five | Six | Four |
| Ten | Eleven | Nine |
| Seven | Eight | Six |
| Two | Three | One |


How about a yummy crepe?

It can also be centered!

Here's a code chunk:

~~~
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
~~~

And here is the same code with syntax highlighting:

```javascript
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
```

And here is the same code yet again but with line numbers:

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
{% endhighlight %}

## Boxes
You can add notification, warning and error boxes like this:

### Notification

{: .box-note}
**Note:** This is a notification box.

### Warning

{: .box-warning}
**Warning:** This is a warning box.

### Error

{: .box-error}
**Error:** This is an error box.
