# Introduction

Friendship is a significant component of social life in most cultures. But are the friendships behaviours identical among countries? Do the political decisions or geography of the country influence the way of friendship is expressed? That is what we will try to discover.

*"A friend is one that knows you as you are, understands where you have been, accepts what you have become, and still, gently allows you to grow."* - William Shakespeare

{: .box-note}
*"Some people go to priests, others to poetry. I go to my friends."* - Virginia Woolf

{: .box-note}
*"There is nothing better than a friend, unless it is a friend with chocolate."* - Linda Grayson 

Determining what can favour friendship is a powerful tool to fight the threats of isolation and depression, that is growing each year across the world (especially in "westernized" countries. In some countries, like Japan, a name exists to define a person that completely withdraws from society: Hikikomori (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hikikomori>). In addition to this tendency, the sanitary crisis of the year 2020 forced a lot of people to isolate themself. That's why understanding friendship is more crucial than ever.

To do so, we will use data from two social media; from them, we will be able to compute quantitative as well as qualitative friendship characteristics for each country. We will also use a dataset with general information about countries and try to explain from them the friendship characteristics.

# Dataset Presentation

Here's a useless table:

| Number | Next number | Previous number |
| :------ |:--- | :--- |
| Five | Six | Four |
| Ten | Eleven | Nine |
| Seven | Eight | Six |
| Two | Three | One |


How about a yummy crepe?

It can also be centered!

Here's a code chunk:

~~~
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
~~~

And here is the same code with syntax highlighting:

```javascript
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
```

And here is the same code yet again but with line numbers:

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
{% endhighlight %}

## Boxes
You can add notification, warning and error boxes like this:

### Notification

{: .box-note}
**Note:** This is a notification box.

### Warning

{: .box-warning}
**Warning:** This is a warning box.

### Error

{: .box-error}
**Error:** This is an error box.
