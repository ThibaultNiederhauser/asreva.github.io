# Introduction

Friendship is a significant component of social life in most cultures. But are the friendships behaviours identical among countries? Do the political decisions or geography of the country influence the way of friendship is expressed? That is what we will try to discover.

Determining what can favour friendship is a powerful tool to fight the threats of isolation and depression, that are growing each year across the world (especially in "westernized" countries). In some countries, like Japan, a name exists to define a person that completely withdraws from society: Hikikomori (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hikikomori>). In addition to this tendency, the 2020's sanitary crisis forced a lot of people to isolate themself. That's why understanding friendship is more crucial than ever.

To do so, we will use data from two social media; from them, we will be able to compute quantitative as well as qualitative friendship characteristics for each country. We will also use a dataset with general information about countries and try to explain from them the friendship characteristics.
