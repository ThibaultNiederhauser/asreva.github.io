# Introduction

Friendship is a significant component of social life in most cultures. But are the friendships behaviours identical among countries? Do the politic, the economy or the geography of the country influence the way of friendship is expressed? That is what we will study.

Determining what can favour friendship is a powerful tool to fight the threats of isolation and depression, that are growing each year across the world (especially in "westernized" countries). In some countries, like Japan, a name exists to define a person that completely withdraws from society: Hikikomori (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hikikomori>). In addition to this tendency, the 2020's sanitary crisis forced a lot of people to isolate themself. That's why understanding friendship is more crucial than ever.

To do so, we will use data from two social media; from them, we will be able to compute quantitative as well as qualitative friendship characteristics for each country. We will also use a dataset with general information about countries and try to explain from them the friendship characteristics.

# Datasets Presentation

To understand how friendship is expressed we use two datasets from worldwide social media: Gowalla and BrightKite. Each one of these datasets is composed of two different datasets. The first registers all the checkins, with each time who did checkin, where and when. The second is the friendship relationship between users. We consider here undirected friendship (i.e. both have to be friends). Combining the two datasets we have around 10.9 millions of checkins, 250k users and 1.1 million edges (friendships). Below we show a typical checkin line from the dataset. Data were collected from Feb. 2009 to Oct. 2010 for Gowalla and from Apr. 2008 to Oct. 2010 for BrightKite.

We also use three datasets that have general information about countries:
1. Compilation of UNData: <https://www.kaggle.com/sudalairajkumar/undata-country-profiles>. Different characteristics for each country.
2. Compilation of USGovt: <https://www.kaggle.com/fernandol/countries-of-the-world>. More characteristics for each country.
3. happiness2020.pkl and countries_info.csv from "tutorial 01- Handling data". More characteristics for each country.
We do not enumerate all the characteristics as they are many of them, but we will present the one that we will keep for the analysis in the Preprocessing section.
