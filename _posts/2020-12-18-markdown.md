# Introduction

Friendship is a significant component of social life in most cultures. Nevertheless, are the friendships behaviours identical among countries? Do the politic, the economy or the geography of the country influence the way of friendship is expressed? That is what we will study.

Determining what can favour friendship is a powerful tool to fight the threats of isolation and depression, that are growing each year across the world (especially in "westernized" countries). In some countries, like Japan, a name exists to define a person that completely withdraws from society: Hikikomori (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hikikomori>). In addition to this tendency, the 2020's sanitary crisis forced many people to isolate themself. That is why understanding friendship is more crucial than ever.

To do so, we will use data from two social media; from them, we will be able to compute quantitative as well as qualitative friendship characteristics for each country. We will also use datasets with general information about countries and try to explain how they can influence friendship characteristics.

# Datasets Presentation

To understand how friendship is expressed, we use two datasets from worldwide social media: Gowalla and BrightKite. Each one of these datasets is composed of two different datasets. The first one registers all the checkins: who dit it, where and when (see example below). The second one is the friendship relationship between users. We consider here undirected friendship (i.e. both have to be friends). Combining the two datasets, we have around 10.9 millions of checkins, 250k users and 1.1 million edges (friendships). Data were collected from Feb. 2009 to Oct. 2010 for Gowalla and from Apr. 2008 to Oct. 2010 for BrightKite.

![checkin_sample](https://asreva.github.io/typical_checkin.jpg){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

We also use three datasets that have general information about countries:
1. Compilation of UNData: <https://www.kaggle.com/sudalairajkumar/undata-country-profiles>. Different characteristics for each country.
2. Compilation of USGovt: <https://www.kaggle.com/fernandol/countries-of-the-world>. More characteristics for each country.
3. happiness2020.pkl and countries_info.csv from "tutorial 01- Handling data". More characteristics for each country.

We do not enumerate all the characteristics as they are many of them, but they encompass a high diversity of themes, like education, economy, healthcare...

# Preprocessing
## Merging
The merge of the country's datasets is not trivial. Many issues came from the countries names, that were different depending on the dataset (United States or United States of America). We decided to convert all the country names to the alpha-3 notation that uses three letters to represent each country (however some country have the same as best and worst Korea). We also had to remove territories that have a special status and were considered as countries (like Guadeloupe). Eventually, we remained with 127 countries and 40 features for each country.

![all_countries](https://asreva.github.io/all_countries.png){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

## Place of residence 
For each user, we computed its place of residence (i.e. its home). We followed the methodology proposed in the paper *Friendship and Mobility: User Movements in Location-Based Social Networks*, by Eunjoon Cho et al. They propose to discretize the world in squares of 25kmx25km and to compute for each user the square with more checkins and then, to assign the home as the mean of all the checkins position inside this square. Note that they used the same social network datasets than us. From the home position, we were able to compute the country of residence of each user.

## Data reduction
40 features is a lot and not all of them where relevant, so we decided to remove some of them. In the end, we kept 26 features that may influence friendship.

Not all countries are good candidates for our study. We have to ensure that the country has enough users, so our result is relevant. Below you can see the countries coloured with respect to the density of users. Countries in white are not in our dataset. Lighter red corresponds to one user per 10'000 inhabitants and dark to less than one per million.

![density_countries](https://asreva.github.io/density_countries.png){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

We see that most of the countries have a minimum density of users and so are not relevant. We decided to only keep the country with more than one user per 100'000 inhabitants. Density is not all, in order to study the friendship behaviour we have to ensure that a minimum cluster of people that may befriend exists in the country, so we added a second selection criterion: a minimum of users in the country. It has been fixed to 100. Both the minimum density and the minimum number been found in a heuristic way, trying to maximize them and still have enough countries for an interesting comparison. In the end, we have 47 countries, they are represented below.

# Friendship characteristics
## Computation
### Quantitative
First, we are interested on the quantitative aspect of friendship, in the following table we present them:

<center>
| Name        | Description |
| ------------- |-------------|
| Nb of friends      | The number of friends that the user has |
| Nb of friends in the same country      | The number of friend that the user has in the country where she/he lives| 
| ratio of friends in the same country | The number of friends in the same country divided by the total number of friends|
| Nb of friends near | The number of friends that the user has in a radius of 50km around his/her home|
| ratio of friends near | The number of friends in the near divided by the total number of friends|
  </center>

### Qualitative
We also want to inspect the notion of quality (closeness). To do so we use the following features:
<center>
| Name        | Description |
| ------------- |-------------|
| Avg nb of meeting      | The number of times that a user meets her/his friends |
| Nb of meeting with his/her best friend | The number of meeting that the user had with her/his bestfriend| 
| Nb of friends met | The number of friends that the user has met at least one time|
  </center>

We consider that two users met if they checked in the same place within a 15min interval. The best friend is the friend that the user met the most. The best friend information has been created because most of the friends never met, as consequence the distribution of meetings is hard to deal with. We hope that the number of meeting with the best friend may represent in a better way the meeting interaction between friends.

### Compute and merge
For each user, we compute her/his characteristics:

![friendship_infos](https://asreva.github.io/friendships_infos.jpg){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

Then, we regroup all the user's information with respect to their country, and we compute the mean of each feature for each country. Note that, when available, we only keep the ratio and not raw numbers. 

![friends_infos_country](https://asreva.github.io/friendships_infos_country.jpg){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

## Inspection
Now that we have computed the friendship characteristics, we can inspect them to see if the features vary depending on the country.

### Clustering
One first and naive way is to perform clustering on the friendship features of each country to see if some countries share similar behaviours (data have been standardized before). We use Gaussian Model Mixture for the clustering, as it provides more flexibility than K-means that assumes spherical clusters. We computed it for a number of clusters varying from one to the total number of countries and evaluated the AIC and BIC metrics. These metrics have to be minimized; their results are plotted below as well as the cluster assignment.

![aic_bic](https://asreva.github.io/aic_bic_friendship.png){: .mx-auto.d-block :}
![cluster_friendship](https://asreva.github.io/cluster_friendship.png){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

The optimal number of clusters is around 12 clusters, which indicates us that the friendships characteristics vary among countries. If the features would have been similar within some groups of countries the number would be smaller, like it happens for the same cluster method applied to the countries features, where the optimal number of clusters is 4, which reveals some common relations, one can find their cluster assignment below. Interestingly, North, Center and South Europe are quite well clustered. The importance of the economy in the general country features may explain this separation.

![cluster_general](https://asreva.github.io/cluster_general.png){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

### PCA
Another way to see that the features vary in function of the country is to use the loadings of the Principal Component Analysis (PCA). First, we apply a standard PCA on the whole friendship and general information about country space to find the principal components (PC), for each PC, we can compute its loadings (how much each initial feature influenced it). The PCs that explain 95% of the variance have the following principal initial features: health expenditure, energy supply per capita, happiness score, age distribution, individuals using Internet, number of friends, urban population, tertiary education, GPD growth rate, coastline, GPD per capita and average meetings. It is interesting to see that along with all the features that explain 95% the variance two information are related to friendship, which means that it is not constant among countries. 

### Boxplots
A more robust way to analyze the data is to plot the boxplot of each feature among the countries and compare them.

![cluster_general](https://asreva.github.io/boxplot_quant.png){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

Let's start with the quantitative features (above). First, for the ratio of friends near, we see entirely different results depending on the country. Some boxplot embrace the whole range of possibilities, and others are concentrated around zero with some outliers, it may depend on the country density of population and other factors. Second, for the ratio of friends in the same country, some different values appear. The most striking one is Japan that, in opposition to a lot of countries, are mainly friends with other Japanese. Some cultural and geographical reasons may explain this. The distribution of the number of friends is more common between the different countries, although not identical. Please note that for this last plot we do not show the outliers because some of them have very high value and so the distribution is hard to see.

**Quantitative friendships characteristics definitely seems to be influenced by the country.** 

![cluster_general](https://asreva.github.io/boxplot_qual.png){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

Now, we can have a glance at the qualitative features. We see that for all the countries and all the features, the distribution is around zero. This is due to the fact that most of the users never meet their friends (we will talk about it in the discussion). As a consequence, it hard to say if there is a difference between the countries from this plot.

**Qualitative friendships characteristics have a lot of zero values.**

### Statistical tests
Now that we saw that some features seem to have different among countries, we want to verify that in a statistical way.

#### One-way ANOVA test
One-way ANOVA (ANalysis Of the VAriance) is one way to do it. The null hypothesis of this method assumes that samples in all groups are generated by populations with the same mean and that this generation is normal. If we refute the null hypothesis, it means that at least one population is generated by a different mean. Here our samples are the value of the friendship characteristic, and the groups are the country. In the following table, we present the results for the One-way ANOVA tests:

<center>
| Feature        | P-value |
| ------------- |-------------|
| Nb of friends      | 0 |
| ratio of friends in the same country | 0 |
| ratio of friends near | <0.01|
| Avg nb of meeting      |<0.01 |
| Nb of meeting with his/her best friend | <0.01 | 
| Nb of friends met | <0.01|
</center>
With such low p-values we can reject the null hypothesis for all the features. That means that at least one of the group (country) has been generated by a distribution that has not the same mean as the others.

However, these results have to be considered with precaution as it is not sure if the normal condition is satisfied. For example, if we plot the histogram of the average meetings in Canada, we see that the distribution is more similar to a power-law than a normal, same happens with most of the countries.

![cluster_general](https://asreva.github.io/hist_anova.jpg){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

#### Kruskal-Wallis test
To handle this issue, we can use the Kruskal-Wallis test that does not assume the normal distribution. This time, the null hypothesis is that the median of each group is the same. The computation gives us:

<center>
| Feature        | P-value |
| ------------- |-------------|
| Nb of friends      | 0 |
| ratio of friends in the same country | 0 |
| ratio of friends near |  0|
| Avg nb of meeting      |  < 0.001|
| Nb of meeting with his/her best friend |  < 0.001 | 
| Nb of friends met |  < 0.001|
</center>
Again, we can refute the null hypothesis; as a consequence, the samples of at least one group have been generated by a distribution that does not have the same median that the others.

**Statistical tests proved that friendship features vary in function of the country.**

# Relation between countries and friendship features
We know that the country of residence impacts friendship behaviours. Now, we will try to figure if with our country facts dataset we can try to infer what are differences between these countries are responsible for it.

## Correlation matrix
Let's take a glance to the correlation matrix to see which features may be correlated. We will highlight the different correlation that may make sense and that have at least 0.3 value of correlation.

![cluster_general](https://asreva.github.io/correlation.jpg){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

First, let's look at the intercorrelation between the friendship features:
* The three qualitative features are highly correlated, which makes sense as someone who is used to meet his friend we have more meetings and meet more often his/her best friend.
* The ratio of a friend near and friends in the same country is correlated, which is logical.
* The qualitative characteristics depend on the number of friends near and in the same country. We explain that by the fact that it is easier to meet someone near to use.
* A surprising correlation is that the number of friends seems to slightly decrease with the number of friends near.

*The ratio of friends near to the user* seem to be influenced by urban population: if a country has more urban population, people will have friends that live closer.

*The ratio of friends in the same country* also seems to be correlated to urban population: people in the cities were had maybe more access to the Internet, and so people are more able to befriend with compatriots. However, the urban population growth rate has the opposite effect and may hide another feature.

*The number of friends* seems not to be influenced by the countries features.

*The three qualitative features* have some correlations but there is no explanation for them.

*Friendship features are highly intercorrelated and some of them are correlated to countries features.*

![cluster_general](https://asreva.github.io/pairplot.png){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

## Regression
In the last section, we highlighted some correlation, but the value of correlation is not sufficient. It is also necessary to see to which extent we can trust the result. That it is why we apply a regression from all the countries features to each friendship characteristic, note that before regression data are standardized and that we will only display the features that have less than 0.05 of p-value.

### Friends near

<center>
| Feature        | Coef | P-value|
| ------------- |-------------|-------------|
|Generosity|-1.04|0.02|
|Perception of corruption|-1.63|0.03|
|Primary Eudcation|-404.79|0.03|
|Energy supply per capita|407.80|0.03|
</center>
### Friends in the same country

<center>
| Feature        | Coef | P-value|
| ------------- |-------------|-------------|
|Generosity|-0.82|0.033|
|Perception of corruption|-1.27|0.04|
</center>
<span style="color:blue">ADD DISCUSSION</span>

### Total number of friends

*For this regression a lot of features have a low p-value, we only display the one that has a logical explanation.*
<center>
| Feature        | Coef | P-value|
| ------------- |-------------|-------------|
|Forested area|-59.96|0.03|
|Tertiary Education|0.49|0.05|
|Primary Eudcation|446.79|0.01|
|Urban population|0.76|0.02|
|GDP per capita|0.96|0.01|
</center>
### Average number of meetings

*No feature has more than 0.05 of p-value*

### number of friends met

<center>
| Feature        | Coef | P-value|
| ------------- |-------------|-------------|
|Perception of corruption|-1.87 |0.03|
</center>
### Number of best friends meetings

<center>
| Feature        | Coef | P-value|
| ------------- |-------------|-------------|
|International migrant stock|90.97|0.01|
|Forested area|-90.35|0.01|
  </center>

### Discuss the regression
A lot of these results make no sense, for example, that the generosity diminishes the number of friends near. They are the results of hidden features. For example, the high weight of the international migrant stock in the number of best friend meetings may hide the fact that countries with a high migrant stock are countries with higher stability and quality of life, and so that people have more access to social media and have more time to see their friends. 

However, some of the relations are interesting and make sense. The inverse correlation between the number of friends and the forested areas, for example, as forested areas may be less suitable to travel and to highly dense areas.

**Using regression, we can find some interesting relation between countries features and friendship expression. But, we also see relation due to hidden features.**

## Pairplot
One may argue that we did not find much good relation during the regression because we are doing linear regression. However, a glance at the pairplots shows that most of the paired comparison are random, and sometimes have some linear tendency. In the following plot, we show you some examples.
